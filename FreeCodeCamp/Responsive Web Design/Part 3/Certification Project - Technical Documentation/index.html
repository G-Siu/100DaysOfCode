            <p>Python is a popular high-level, versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
                It has a wide range of uses from web development, to data science and artificial intelligence, etc.</p>
            <p>Some key characterstics and features include:</p>

                <li>
                    <b>Readibility</b>: Python's syntax is easily readable, and resembles the English language
                    structure. The readibility reduces the cost of development and maintenance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Versatility</b>: Python supports multiple programming paradigms, such as object-oriented, and
                    functional, giving developers a variety of approaches to reach a solution for their projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Interpreted & Interactive</b>: As an interpreted language, code is executed line-by-line by an
                    interpreter, enabling quick development and debugging. The language comes with interactive shells
                    for testing code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Rich Standard Library</b>: Python contains a vast library of modules and functions as standard,
                    reducing the need for external modules.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Extensive Ecosystem</b>: Third party packages and frameworks can be leveraged by developers.
                    These include Django and Flask for web developments, NumPy and Pandas for data analysis, Tensorflow
                    and PyTorch for machine learning, and more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Platform Independence</b>: Largely platform independent code means Python programs is compatible
                    on various operating systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Community & Support</b>: The Python community is large and active, contributing to its growth,
                    with support coming from numerous resources and documentation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Open Source</b>: Python is open source, encouraging developers to collaborate, contribute,
                    expand, and improve.

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>To start your coding journey in a programming language, it is common to start with displaying "Hello
                World".</p>
            <!-- 6.The .main-section elements should contain at least five code elements total (not each)-->
            <code>print("Hello World")</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You can store values by assigning them to a variable. Variables are useful for values that are required
                on multiple occassions.
            <p>Variables should follow a naming convention commonly used in Python. This may be in camelCase, where the
                initial letter is lowercase, and the following words are capitalised. However, according to PEP 8 Style
                Guide for Python, variables (and functions) should follow the snake_case, unless camelCase is required
                for context to retain backwards compatibility.</p>
            <p>An appropriate identifier should be concise and clear as to the purpose of the variable for future
                reference.</p>
            <p>An example is given below:</p>
            <code>house_number = 11</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
            <header>Data Types</header>
            <p>Python can store various data types in variables:</p>
            <li>
                Text: <code class="data">str</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Numeric: <code class="data">int, float, complex</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Sequence: <code class="data">list, tuple, range</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Mapping: <code class="data">dict</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Set: <code class="data">set, frozenset</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Boolean: <code class="data">bool</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                Binary: <code class="data">bytes, bytearray, memoryview</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                None: <code class="data">NoneType</code>
            </li>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Operators">
            <header>Operators</header>
            <p>Python operators are available for mathematic calculations on variables and values. Example of adding two
                values:</p>
            <code>num1 = 3</code>
            <code>num2 = 5</code>
            <code>total = num1 + num2</code>
            <p>Operators categories include:</p>
            <li>
                Arithmetic operators
            </li>
