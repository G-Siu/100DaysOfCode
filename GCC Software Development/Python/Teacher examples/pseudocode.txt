Scenario

We are required to get the name of the adult and then the number of children that they have.
Once we find out the number of children, we ask them how many tickets they need.
Each ticket is Â£10. Print the total cost of the tickets.  If number of tickets required is greater 
than the number of children display an error message.

Algorithm (Pseudocode)


SET ticket to 10
PRINT Please enter name
GET name
PRINT How many children do you have?
GET children
PRINT How many tickets do you need?
GET tickets
IF tickets greater than children
   PRINT Error
cost = tickets * ticket
PRINT Total cost is {cost}

Python

ticket = 10
print("Please enter name : ")
name = input()
print("How many children do you have ? ")
children = int(input())
print("How many tickets ? ")
tickets = int(input())
if tickets > children:
    print("Error")
cost = tickets * ticket
print(f"Total cost is {cost}")


Scenario

Ask for students mark which is out of 0 to 100, then calculate grade.  If the entered grade is 
less than 0 or greater than 100 then display an error message.  Then display grade.
A >= 70
B >= 60
C >= 50
Less than 50 is a Fail

Pseudocode

PRINT Enter students mark
DO
   INPUT mark
WHILE mark < 0 OR mark > 100
IF mark >= 70
    grade =  A
ELSE IF mark >= 60
    grade = B
ELSE IF mark >= 50
    grade = C
ELSE
    grade = Fail

PRINT grade

PYTHON

print("Please enter mark : ")
mark = 0
grade = ""
while mark < 0 or mark > 100:
    mark = int(input())
if mark >= 70:
    grade = "A"
elif mark >= 60:
    grade = "B"
elif mark >= 50:
    grade = "C"
else:
    grade = "Fail"

print(grade)
